<h1>Bill Zheng</h1>
<p>I am a third-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Enginerring and Computer Science (EECS). I am currently conducting research under advisory of Prof. Jitendra Malik at Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Group (BAIR), specializing in computer vision models for robotics. Previously I worked with Prof. Mark Vogelsberger at MIT's physics department in representation learning.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, I am interested in skill-discovery: how can autonomous agents learn policies in real-world that resemble or sometimes exceed human performance with little training? By extension, I am also interested in machine learning theory, espeically in the field of in-context learning and meta learning, and any few-shot learning techniques that are transferrable to real world.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Concise REPTILE</h3>

<p>REPTILE is a meta-learning algorithm that considerably lowers the computational cost of traditional meta-learning algorithm. This is a concise implementation of such algorithm and it has shown strong few-shot learning results in regression and simple classification.</p>

<h3>CS182 Final Project</h3>

<h3>CS180 Projects</h3>

<h2>Volunteering</h2>

<p>I am actively involved in Computer Science Mentors (CSM), a student-led organization at UC Berkeley teaching lower division CS and EECS classes to students in need. I am currently volunteering as a Senior Mentor teaching EECS16B, an introductory class in electronics, control theory, and linear algebra for EE and CS. </p>
